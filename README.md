### Using React or another JS-based templating framework?
Use the [Babel Plugin](https://github.com/soluml/babel-plugin-pre-style) instead of the root project to save yourself some hassle!

## Another CSS-in-JS tool... why?
Unlike many of the other projects from which this project takes inspiration in many areas, Pre-Style places a priority on end-user performance while maintaining great usability for it's developers. Your end-user's don't care what your classes look like. They just want to use your app as soon as possible. Developers don't want to learn another proprietary syntax to author CSS. You won't have too.

## Usage
